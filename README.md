# Manicore

Manicore - Library to implement schemes on n-dimensional manifolds.

This library stem from the HArD::Core library (https://github.com/jdroniou/HArDCore) and the generalization of the Polytopal Exterior Calculus (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.11093) to manifolds with general Riemannian metric.

See the [documentation page](https://mlhanot.github.io/Manicore/) for a detailed description and usage information.
